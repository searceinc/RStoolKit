# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## How to contribute:

* [Report a bug](#how-to-report-bugs)
* [Raise a feature request](#how-to-request-features)
* [Build a new feature myself](#how-to-build-features-yourself)

## How to Report Bugs

If you found any issues/bug in this, we encorge your to report to us. But before reporting the bug, please go through the [issues](https://github.com/searceinc/RStoolKit/issues) section. May be someone already reported that issue. You can refer the [closed issues](https://github.com/searceinc/RStoolKit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) section as well.

If nothing is reported before, then please create a new issue and include as much details as you can - what you're seeing now, and what you'd expect to see instead.

## How to Request Features

Open source is community-built software. Anyone is welcome to build things that would help make their job easier.

If you want something, you're going to either need to build it yourself, or convince someone else to devote their free time to your feature request. You can do that by sponsoring development (offering to hire a developer to build it for you), or getting people excited enough that they volunteer to build it for you.

And good news! Lots of people have contributed their code over time. Here's how to get started.

## How to Build Features Yourself

When you're ready to start coding, discuss it with the community. Check the [Github issues list] and the [closed issues list] because folks may have tried it in the past, or the community may have decided it's not a good fit for these tools.

If you can't find it in an existing issue, open a new Github issue for it. Outline what you'd like to do, why you'd like to do it, and optionally, how you'd think about coding it. This just helps make sure other users agree that it's a good idea to add to these tools. Other folks will respond to the idea, and if you get a warm reception, go for it!

After your Github issue has gotten good responses from a couple of volunteers who are willing to test your work, get started by forking the project and working on your own server. The Github instructions are below - it isn't exactly easy, and we totally understand if you're not up for it. Thing is, we can't take code contributions via text requests - Github makes it way easier for us to compare your work versus the changes other people have made, and merge them all together.

Note that if you're not ready to get started coding in the next week, or if you think you can't finish the feature in the next 30 days, you probably don't want to bother opening an issue. You're only going to feel guilty over not making progress, because we'll keep checking in with you to see how it's going. We don't want to have stale "someday I'll build that" issues in the list - we want to keep the open issues list easy to scan for folks who are trying to troubleshoot bugs and feature requests.

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[bhuvaneshwaran.r@searce.com].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.
